  <!-- ====== BALISAGE & SIGLES ====== -->
  <string name="ih_markings_body">GR (Great Hiking): white/red marking; itineraries of several days.
GRP (Country GR): yellow/red marking; loops/crossings on a territory scale.
• PR (Promenade &amp; Hiking): yellow marking; loops at half day/day.

Makes (forms):
• 
• - = turn left
• - = turn right
• (or X) = wrong direction (turn back)

To know (very useful in the field):
• At the intersections, first look for the brand "good way" ( If you see one, you go in the wrong direction.
• Often, a confirmation mark is placed a few dozen meters after the branch line.
• If you haven't seen a mark for a while: calmly return to the last safe spot (last mark).
• Marks can be on rocks, trunks, poles, walls: sweep to the left/right of the trail and a little higher.
• Apart from official routes, local signage can vary: follow the signs on site and remain consistent with the map/trace.

Benchmark: the official markup of GR/GRP/PR is defined by the FFRandonnée.</string>
  <!-- ====== MÉTÉO & ORAGES (général) ====== -->
  <string name="ih_weather_body">Before leaving:
• Consult a local newsletter + evolution hour by hour (wind, rain, thunderstorms).
• Look also: temperature felt in altitude, gusts on peaks, limit rain/snow (if season).
• Plan B: shorter/lower route + loops (fast return).

Thunderstorms (simple rules):
• Avoid ridges, peaks, edges, clear areas when risk increases.
• Remove metal objects (sticks, fences) and move away from isolated trees.
• Flash-to-bang: &lt; 30 s between lightning and thunder 
• Safety position: squat on bag/insulating, feet joints, hands on knees; avoids stretching.
• As a group: spread out (10 m) to limit the risk of collective impact.
• Wait 30 minutes after the last thunder before you leave.

Other weather traps:
• Strong wind: caution on edges/coles (disequilibrium), move away from the edges.
• Heavy rain: attention to flash floods (valley bottoms, ravines) + slides.
• Fog: slows down, stays grouped, pointing forward (sign, crossing, secondary top).</string>
  <!-- ====== ORIENTATION & PROGRESSION ====== -->
  <string name="ih_orient_body">Before leaving:
• Realistically estimate: distance + elevation + duration (margin!), water points, shadow zones, escape.
• Download card/trace offline; Check battery + economy mode.
• Inform a relative (route + return time): it's simple, it saves.

In the field:
• Checks regularly: marking, map, relief (vallon/peak), next marker step.
• At intersections: take a break, confirm the direction BEFORE you engage.
• Rhythm: regular; micro-pause; drink early (before being thirsty); eat before being drunk.

Group:
• The slowest one gives the rhythm. Fixed waiting points. Walking farm.
• If someone is tired: shorten/down early (before being at the end).

If you doubt / if you're lost:
• STOP: Stop, breathe, observe, find the last safe spot, plan.
• Returning to the last safe point is often the best solution (simple and effective).
• If weather/night/danger: shelter + heat + battery economy; alert if necessary.</string>
  <!-- ====== RESPECT DE LA NATURE ====== -->
  <string name="ih_respect_body">Rule without trace:
• Carry all your waste (even biodegradable). Don't leave handkerchiefs.
• Natural needs: away from trails and water points; bury (small hole) and plug if possible.
• Silence: avoids strong/cris music (fauna + other hikers). Stay quiet near the houses.

Wildlife/herds:
• Keep your distance (especially young/wild animals). Don't feed.
• Dogs: often forbidden in the heart of the park; elsewhere, leave according to zones/periods (troupeaux, fauna).
• If patous: stay calm, bypass widely, do not run, keep the dog close to you (or without leash if necessary to avoid conflict — depending on the situation).

Protected areas:
• Stay on the trails (erosion + fragile areas).
• Drones: frequently prohibited (especially park hearts) unless authorized.

Altitude lakes:
• Often not recommended: fragile ecosystems + pollution (creams) + very cold water (hypothermia) + sometimes prohibited by decree.

Bivouac / Fire:
• Bivouac often tolerated 1 night ( remains &gt; 20 m from the lakes/river.
• Fires often forbidden: prefers a stove and respects local orders.</string>
  <!-- ====== PREMIERS SECOURS & SOS ====== -->
  <string name="ih_firstaid_body">Emergency response (France):
• 112 (European number) — often operates without a conventional network.
• 114 (SMS) if call impossible (also useful if you can't talk).
• 15 (SAMU) / 18 (Firemen) / 17 (Police) according to situation.

To say on the phone:
• Where? (common/sector, col/refuge/sign, GPS coordinates if possible)
• What? (fall, malaise, injury) — how many people — condition (conscious? breathing?)
• Possible access (road/track, landmark, on-site weather)

Useful gestures (simple):
• Protect – Alert – Help: secure the area first.
• Haemorrhage: direct strong compression.
• Unconscious who breathes: PLS, cover, monitor.
• Tightness/fracture: immobilize, avoid walking, keep warm.
• Hypothermia: isolating from the ground, cutting the wind, removing the wet, covering.
• Warmness: shadow, refresh, drink in small sips, stop the effort.

Lost / locked in:
• Stay together, save the battery, mark your position, shelter, signal yourself (blow/lamp).</string>
